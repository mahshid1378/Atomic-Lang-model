# Formal Language Theory and Grammar Hierarchies

## The Mathematical Framework Behind Language

Formal language theory provides the mathematical foundation for understanding how recursive structures in human language can be precisely characterized and computed.

## The Chomsky Hierarchy

Languages are classified by the power of grammars needed to generate them:

### Type 3: Regular Languages
**Grammar Form**: A → aB or A → a
```
Finite-state automaton
Memory: Constant
Example: (ab)*
```

**Limitations**: Cannot handle center-embedding like aⁿbⁿ

### Type 2: Context-Free Languages  
**Grammar Form**: A → α (where α is any string)
```
Push-down automaton
Memory: Stack (unbounded)
Example: aⁿbⁿ, balanced parentheses
```

**Power**: Handles nested structures but not cross-serial dependencies

### Type 1: Context-Sensitive Languages
**Grammar Form**: αAβ → αγβ (where |γ| ≥ 1)
```
Linear-bounded automaton
Memory: Polynomial in input length
Example: aⁿbⁿcⁿ
```

### Type 0: Recursively Enumerable
**Grammar Form**: α → β (unrestricted)
```
Turing machine
Memory: Unlimited
Example: Any computable language
```

## Where Human Language Fits

### Mildly Context-Sensitive Languages

Human language appears to require grammars slightly more powerful than context-free but much less than fully context-sensitive:

```
Regular ⊂ Context-Free ⊂ Mildly Context-Sensitive ⊂ Context-Sensitive
```

**Properties of Mildly Context-Sensitive:**
- Polynomial parsing time
- Constant growth property  
- Limited cross-serial dependencies
- Semilinear Parikh images

## Minimalist Grammars (MGs)

### Algebraic Formulation

Stabler (1997) formalized Chomsky's Merge operation:

```
MG = ⟨V, C, Lex, F⟩
```

Where:
- **V**: Feature values
- **C**: Syntactic categories  
- **Lex ⊂ V***: Finite lexicon of feature strings
- **F**: Structure-building functions

### Core Operations

**Merge**: 
```
Merge(X, Y) = {X, Y}
```

**Move**:
```
Move±f(X) = rearrange X based on feature ±f
```

### Mathematical Properties

**Theorem** (Stabler 1997): Every MG language is equivalent to a multiple context-free language.

This places human syntax in a mathematically precise complexity class that is:
- More powerful than context-free
- Polynomial-time parsable
- Empirically adequate for natural language

## Recursive Definition Examples

### Simple Recursive Grammar
```
S → aSb | ε
```
Generates: {ε, ab, aabb, aaabbb, ...} = {aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0}

### Natural Language Recursion
```
NP → Det N (CP)
CP → C S
S → NP VP
```

Enables unlimited embedding:
"The student [who the professor [that Mary knows] taught] left"

## Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAGs)

### Definition
TAGs consist of:
- **Elementary trees**: Minimal linguistic structures
- **Adjunction operation**: Inserts trees into other trees
- **Substitution operation**: Replaces frontier nodes

### Mathematical Properties
- **Weak generative capacity**: Mildly context-sensitive
- **Strong generative capacity**: Between CFG and CSG
- **Recognition complexity**: O(n⁶) worst case

### Example TAG Derivation
```
Initial tree: [S [NP John] [VP [V sleeps]]]
Auxiliary tree: [VP [Adv often] [VP* ]]
Result: [S [NP John] [VP [Adv often] [VP [V sleeps]]]]
```

## Computational Complexity

### Recognition Problems

| Grammar Class | Recognition Time | Memory Model |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Regular | O(n) | Finite automaton |
| Context-free | O(n³) | Push-down automaton |
| TAG | O(n⁶) | Embedded push-down |
| Context-sensitive | PSPACE-complete | Linear-bounded |

### Parsing Algorithms

**Earley Parser** (Context-free):
```
Chart[i,j] = {A → α • β | A derives span from i to j}
```

**CKY Algorithm**:
```
For each span length l = 1 to n:
  For each start position i:
    For each split point k:
      Combine(i,k) ∪ Combine(k,j) → Combine(i,j)
```

## Feature-Based Grammars

### Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)

Uses typed feature structures:
```
[PHON: "cats"
 HEAD: [AGR: [NUM: pl]]
 SUBCAT: ⟨⟩]
```

### Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG)

Separates constituent structure (c-structure) from functional structure (f-structure):
```
C-structure: [S [NP Mary] [VP [V sees] [NP John]]]
F-structure: [PRED: 'see⟨SUBJ,OBJ⟩'
              SUBJ: [PRED: 'Mary']
              OBJ: [PRED: 'John']]
```

## Universal Grammar as Mathematical Object

### The Minimalist View
All syntactic computation reduces to:
```
⟨PHON-F, SYN-F, SEM-F, Select, Merge, Transfer⟩
```

Where Merge(x,y) = {x,y} provides the recursive engine.

### Formal Properties
- **Closure**: Merge output can re-enter Merge
- **Compositionality**: Meaning determined by constituent meanings
- **Displacement**: Move operations create dependencies
- **Phases**: Computational domains for Transfer operations

## Connection to Automata Theory

### Push-Down Automata and Context-Free Grammars
**Equivalence**: Every CFG has an equivalent PDA, and vice versa.

**Stack operations**:
- Push symbols for left-recursive rules
- Pop symbols for right-recursive completion
- Empty stack indicates successful parse

### The Role of Memory
Different grammar classes require different memory architectures:
- **Regular**: Finite memory (current state)
- **Context-free**: Stack memory (LIFO)
- **Mildly context-sensitive**: Multiple stacks or tree stack
- **Context-sensitive**: Tape memory (bounded)

This mathematical progression from simple to complex memory models parallels the evolution from basic pattern recognition to human-level language understanding.
